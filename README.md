# Roadmap of DL and ML

[in chinese 中文版](https://github.com/SherlockLiao/Roadmap-of-DL-and-ML/blob/master/README_cn.md)

>For a newecomer to deep learning and machine learning area, facing some much courses and resources, the first question is how to choose right books and courses to begin this trip.

>Here is my roadmap of machine leanring and deep leanring materials. 

The roadmap includes some highly recommended courses, books and papers which can help you get into DL and ML area quickly. Maybe some materials are quite difficult, but really worth reading and studying. 

I would continue adding some items to this roadmap. If you have something to recommend, such as some new material or your study note, welcome to request PR.

## CS 20SI:  TensorFlow for Deep Learning Research
This course will cover the fundamentals and contemporary usage of the Tensorflow library for deep learning research. We aim to help students understand the graphical computational model of Tensorflow, explore the functions it has to offer, and learn how to build and structure models best suited for a deep learning project. Through the course, students will use Tensorflow to build models of different complexity, from simple linear/logistic regression to convolutional neural network and recurrent neural networks with LSTM to solve tasks such as word embeddings, translation, optical character recognition. Students will also learn best practices to structure a model and manage research experiments.

## udacity deep learning
We’ll show you how to train and optimize basic neural networks, convolutional neural networks, and long short term memory networks. Complete learning systems in TensorFlow will be introduced via projects and assignments. You will learn to solve new classes of problems that were once thought prohibitively challenging, and come to better appreciate the complex nature of human intelligence as you solve these same problems effortlessly using deep learning methods.

## Convex Optimization
This course is designed to give a graduate-level student a thorough grounding in these properties and their role in optimization, and a broad comprehension of algorithms tailored to exploit such properties. The focus will be on convex optimization problems (though we also may touch upon nonconvex optimization problems at some points). We will visit and revisit important applications in statistics and machine learning. Upon completing the course, students should be able to approach an optimization problem.

## Statistical Machine Learning
The course combines methodology with theoretical foundations. Theorems are presented together with practical aspects of methodology and intuition to help students develop tools for selecting appropriate methods and approaches to problems in their own research. The course includes topics in statistical theory that are important for researchers in machine learning, including nonparametric theory, consistency, minimax estimation, and concentration of measure.

## CSE 599G1: Deep Learning System
The study of how to build and optimize these deep learning systems is now an active area of research and commercialization, and yet there isn’t a course that covers this topic. This course is designed to fill this gap. We will be covering various aspects of deep learning systems, including: basics of deep learning, programming models for expressing machine learning models, automatic differentiation, memory optimization, scheduling, distributed learning, hardware acceleration, domain specific languages, and model serving.

This course was taught by one of MXNet authors Tianqi Chen, and it is worth learning.
