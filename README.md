# Roadmap of DL and ML

>For a newecomer to deep learning and machine learning area, facing some much courses and resources, the first question is how to choose right books and courses to begin this trip.

>Here is my roadmap of machine leanring and deep leanring materials. I will put my study notes on it.

The roadmap includes some highly recommended courses, books and papers which can help you get into DL and ML area quickly. Maybe some materials are quite difficult, but really worth reading and studying. 

I would continue adding some items to this roadmap. If you have something to recommend, such as some new material or your study note, welcome to request PR.

# course

## Numeraical Linear Algebra
This course is focused on the question: **How do we do matrix computations with acceptable speed and acceptable accuracy?**

This course was taught in the University of San Francisco's Masters of Science in Analystics program, summer 2017.
